## UPDATED: Magnetic Forms\(very Cool\)


</div>

### Description

Gives your Forms a professional touch! With magnetic(automatically docking) Forms. If your using Winamp, you know what I mean. Just move a Winamp window around the screen and it will magnetically snap on the screen border. My Code will not only give you this feature while moving the Forms. Even while resizing! This Code is VERY easy to use.

The new Version now doesn't move the Forms manually. This makes it faste on old PCs and Win9x!

You just have to see it(PLEASE VOTE FOR IT, too)!
